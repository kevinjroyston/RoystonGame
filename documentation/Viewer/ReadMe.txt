You must restart the viewer between each game.

************* NOTES ************
--------------------------------

You can stop and start the viewer at any time, it will not affect the game that is being played.

If you see any kind of display issue, the best option is to close the viewer and reopen it.

Multiple people can run the viewer for the same game.  So if you have people in several locations,
one person can screen share the viewer in a video chat, or each location can run their own copy of
the viewer.
