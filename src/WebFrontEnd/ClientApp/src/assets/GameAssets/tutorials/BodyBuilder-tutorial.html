<h1>Body Builder</h1>
<p>Create your champions from a collection of heads, bodies and legs.</p>
<h2>Stage 1 - Draw Some Body Parts</h2>
<p>You will be asked to draw several body parts.&nbsp; Your device will say "Draw a Head" or "Draw a Body".</p>
<p>A timer will be running, it shows how long you have to complete ALL of your drawings.</p>
<p>A light outline of the body part will appear in the drawing box.&nbsp; Don't simply trace that outline, use it as a guide for the proportions.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to where the neck and the legs line up.&nbsp; If your drawing meets those points, the final result of stacking three random body parts will look much better.</p>
<p>You are not limited to drawing people.&nbsp; Create alien body parts or animals.&nbsp; Put legs on a skateboard or in an ocean.</p>
<h2>Stage 2 - Create Titles</h2>
<p>This is a battle of champions.&nbsp; You create the categories.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"World's best dog walker"<br /> "Least likely to succeed"<br /> "Intergalactic Space Hero"</p>
<p>Tip: Hit the SUGGEST button on top to cycle through some suggested categories.</p>
<h2>Stage 3 - Build A Body</h2>
<p>It's time to assemble your champion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the prompt and scroll through the provided heads, bodies and legs to create the your hero.</p>
<h2>Stage 4 - Describe Your Champion</h2>
<p>Give your champion a name, title or description.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often times a clever description will tip the votes in your direction.</p>
<h2>Stage 5 - Voting</h2>
<p>Look the shared game viewer to see the champions vying for the title.&nbsp; Vote on your device.</p>
<h2>Points</h2>
<p>You get points if your champion receives votes.</p>
<p>You also earn points if other players use the body parts you created.</p>
