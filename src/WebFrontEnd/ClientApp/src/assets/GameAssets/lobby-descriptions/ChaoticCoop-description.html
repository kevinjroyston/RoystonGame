<h3>
    Overview</h3>
Ever feel like you only have half the information that you need? Well, that’s the best you’ll get here. In Chaotic Collaboration you are part of an artistic team, but all you have is a title for the artwork, and a brush with a single color. You have no
idea what your teammates will be painting.

<h3>Goal</h3>
Given a prompt and a color, your job is to draw part of an image that will match up with your teammates drawings to form an amazing work of art. The catch? You have no idea who your teammates are, or what they are going to draw.


<h3>Gameplay</h3>
Create a title for the masterpiece, and choose the colors that will be given to each artist. Pay particular attention to the order of the colors.<br> For example, if you were to title your artwork: The Apple Tree, giving the colors green, red and brown…
make sure that brown is on the bottom layer, green is drawn above that and red is drawn on top of all the other colors. <br> When it is your turn to paint, pay particular attention to the colors the others will be using, it can give you vital clues of
where your color might be used.
