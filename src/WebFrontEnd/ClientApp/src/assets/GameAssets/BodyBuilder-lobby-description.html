    <h1>Body Builder</h1>
    <h2>Overview:</h2><br /> Everyone draws a random assortment of body parts (head, body, feet). Then the pieces are handed out and champions are assembled to battle for the title.


    <h2>Goal</h2>: Select the most interesting character from your supply of body parts. Be sure to give them an interesting name!

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>: You will be asked to draw an assortment of body parts: heads, bodies and feet.<br />
    <br /> Just follow the prompt at the top of your device.<br />
    <br /> Were you asked to draw a head? How about a baseball player, a scientist, an alien, even a fishbowl.<br />
    <br /> Legs? Are they wearing fancy shoes? Barefoot? Bear feet? Put them on a surfboard, have them running, or riding a unicycle.<br />
    <br /> Pay attention to the small purple marks that show you where the pieces will line up with each other, the final pictures will look much better if the pieces match up.<br />
    <br /> After drawing, you’ll need to come up with a few prompts for the “Battle” portion of the game:<br /> Who would make the best substitute teacher?<br /> Who will be the first to walk on Mars.<br /> World’s worst dog-walker.<br />
    <br /> On your device you will be shown a prompt and a collection of body parts. Scroll the body pieces until you make the best character. Then give your creation a name. A good name is vital for raking in those votes.<br />
    <br /> The contestants will appear on the screen and everyone will vote for their favorite.<br />
