<h3>Goal</h3>
Your goal is to ask the brawlers to scrawl somethingâ€¦ anything: a shoe, a horse, a cabin in the woods. Then you will create a special prompt, presented to just one person: the imposter. Everyone will examine all the drawings, and they will choose which
one they feel is the imposter.


<h3>Gameplay</h3>

the drawings will be displayed and it is time to determine which drawing was the imposter.
