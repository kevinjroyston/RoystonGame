<h2>Overview</h2>
Imitation is not only the sincerest form of flattery, it’s also the quickest way to earn points in Mimic.  Study the picture and then do your best to mimic that image.

<h2>Goal</h2>
Study the image on the screen, then do your best to recreate the image on your own device.  Try to mimic it so closely that everyone thinks your drawing is the original.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
Everyone will be asked to draw a quick image.   It can be an object, a scene, or just a random series of squiggles.

Each round someone’s image will appear on the screen.  You only have a few seconds, so study it closely.

Do your best to recreate the drawing on your own device. 

All the drawings will appear on the screen… but completely out of focus.   As the images become sharper, do your best to identify the original.  The quicker you vote, the more points you are awarded.
